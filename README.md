## [Click here for a demo](http://afader.github.io/thompson-regex-js/)
This code implements a regular expression library, including:

* A parser that maps regular expressions to an abstract syntax tree
* A compiler that evaluates the abstract syntax tree to an automaton
* A simulator that runs the automaton against input strings

This is largely a reimplementation of [Russ Cox's work](https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html)
in javascript.
